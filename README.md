# Mage Landing Page

Inspiration from https://github.com/nextui-org/nextui 

## Navbar (sections)
- Home
- Docs
- Primitives
- Sections
- Templates (paid)
- Sample Websites (highlighted)

## Home
- "Build websites at the speed of thought"

## Docs
- What is Mage?
- Installation + Setup
- Theme Modification
- Usage
- Troubleshooting

## Primitives
Similar to [HeadlessUI](headlessui.com)

## Sections
Similar to Flowbite's [blocks](https://flowbite.com/blocks/)

## Templates
Basically [these](https://tailwindui.com/templates), but cheaper.
Also include some Mage-based (not just tailwind) websites??

## Sample Websites
Inspired by [this](https://tailwindcss.com/showcase).
